## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

#```{r cars}
#summary(cars)
#```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

#```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
#plot(pressure)
#```
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
#there are bugs but I don't know why
airquality
head(airquality)
install.packages("lattice")
require(lattice)
bwplot(x = Ozone ~ Month,      # ??onth??X頠賂?zone??Y頠?
       data = airquality,     
       xlab = "Month"         
       )
```
