## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:



## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, }
#install.packages(,"tidyverse")
# install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
#devtools::install_github("tidyverse/ggplot2")
diamonds

#first diagram:cut and count
#drew the fist picture
#I added color. It doesn't symbolize anything, because the system just randomly put color in this way, however, I was still delighted to see it appear.
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = cut,fill = cut)) +
geom_bar(colour = "red")

#modified, add colour maually
#problem I solved: rememer to add # in front of the color ID.
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = cut,fill = cut)) +
geom_bar(colour = "black") +
scale_fill_manual(values=c("#FFFF66", "#FFFF33", "#FFFF00", "#FFCC33", "#FFCC00"))

#second diagram:price and count
#try out another kind of picture
#Problem I solved: fill = price must put inside aes()
#I also learned that I can't add color manually for a continuous data
#It is exciting when I found that this diagram can show more information by adding fill= cut!It is really encouraging to me
#learn binwidth to alter the width of each bar
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = price, fill = cut)) + 
geom_histogram(binwidth = 600) 


#third diagram:depth and count
#learn to determine the type of the data(continue or not)
#I realized that scale_colour_gradientn won't work for geom_histogram()
#practice geom_freqpoly and also add colour = cut to know the difference between diferent sort of diamonds
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = depth, colour = cut)) +
geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 500)



#fourth diagram: price and depth
#when two datas are both not continuous, use geom_point
#I also tried to make changes to color, but I think it is not too meaningful in this case
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = depth, y=price, colour=price)) +
geom_point() +
scale_colour_gradientn(colours=rainbow(4))

#fifth diagram: cut and depth
#challenge:make changes to the color
#problem I solved: At first I added scale_fill_brewer(palette="PuOr")but nothing happened. As it turned out, I forgot to add fill = cut.
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=cut, y=depth, fill=cut)) +
geom_boxplot() +
scale_fill_brewer(palette = "PuOr")


# sixth diagram:
# challenge: change color of the diagram
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=clarity, y=price, fill=clarity)) +
geom_boxplot() +
scale_fill_brewer()


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
