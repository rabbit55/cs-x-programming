## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:



## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, }
#install.packages(,"tidyverse")
# install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
#devtools::install_github("tidyverse/ggplot2")
diamonds
#first diagram:cut and count
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = cut)) +
geom_bar(fill = "blue", colour = "red")
#second diagram:price and count
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = price)) + 
geom_histogram()
#third diagram:depth and count
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = depth)) +
geom_histogram()
#fourth diagram: price and depth
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = price, y=depth)) +
geom_point()
#fifth diagram: cut and depth
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=cut, y=depth)) +
geom_boxplot()
# sixth diagram:
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=clarity, y=price)) +
geom_boxplot()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
